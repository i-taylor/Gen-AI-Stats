    "# Assignment 1: Locating and Exploring Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of the course 'AI-powered Data Analysis'. In this assignment, you will learn how to locate and open datasets stored as CSV files, understand their structure, and explore their components.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Again, you are not required to write any code; just run the cells and observe the outputs, except for the 'Reflection Prompt' section at the end.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore the process of data analysis, starting from the very basics of locating and opening datasets saved as CSV files, understanding their structure, and exploring their components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "When given a dataset, the first step is to look at the metadata. Metadata provides crucial information about the data, such as:\n",
    "- The structure of the dataset (e.g., column names, data types)\n",
    "- Descriptions of the data fields\n",
    "- Information about the source and context of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the metadata is beneficial because:\n",
    "- It helps in comprehending the dataset's structure and content.\n",
    "- It provides insights into the data quality and potential preprocessing steps needed.\n",
    "- It aids in planning the data analysis and visualization strategies effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using three datasets in this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NOAA Weather Dataset**\n",
    "    - This dataset contains weather data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n",
    "    - [Link to Metadata](#)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kaggle Ecommerce Dataset**\n",
    "    - This dataset comprises e-commerce data from Kaggle, including information about transactions, products, and customers.\n",
    "    - [Link to Metadata](#)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Yelp Reviews Dataset**\n",
    "    - This dataset includes reviews from Yelp, with columns such as 'ProductId', 'UserId', 'ProfileName', 'HelpfulnessNumerator', 'HelpfulnessDenominator', 'Score', 'Time', 'Summary', and 'Text'.\n",
    "    - [Link to Metadata](#)\n",
    "\n",
    "After understanding the metadata and the structure of our datasets, we will proceed with coding to explore and analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we have three different datasets housed within the following file directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Datasets/\n",
