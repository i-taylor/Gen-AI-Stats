    "1. Reflect on your overall learning experience with data analysis in this lab. What stood out to you the most, and how will you use this knowledge moving forward?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example Response**: *What stood out to me the most was how important it is to clean and prepare data before analysis. I learned how to remove duplicates and convert data types, which made my analysis more accurate. Moving forward, I will make sure to always clean my data thoroughly before starting any analysis.*\n",
