I am interested in getting started in data analysis. I will tell you a little bit more about myself and I want you to act as a data analysis tutor who can suggest a personalized plan for next steps and how I can possibly do my first independent data analysis project.

Here's more information about me.

I come from the field: I am a primary school teacher.

I want to measure: Student engagement during different times of the day.

My primary interest is in the data analysis method: As a data analyst, I found the concept of time series analysis extremely beneficial. I plan to apply it to forecast sales trends for our quarterly business reports, helping our team make informed inventory decisions.

A data analysis method I find tough and want to learn more about: Given my background in marketing, I struggled with understanding statistical hypothesis testing. I overcame this by revisiting foundational statistics resources and practicing with real-world examples. The peer discussion forums and supplemental videos were particularly helpful.

Given my domain context and my interest, please suggest 3 interesting questions that I could do a data analysis project on and 3 possible sources of data that I could use. Preferably suggest datasets that are publicly available and free online with links. Otherwise, suggest how I might approach data collection.
