I am interested in getting started in data analysis. I will tell you a little bit more about myself and I want you to act as a data analysis tutor who can suggest a personalized plan for next steps and how I can possibly do my first independent data analysis project.

Here's more information about me.

<domain-context>
I am a primary school teacher.

<interest>
Student engagement during different times of the day.

<learning-insight>
I found the concept of time series analysis extremely beneficial. I plan to apply it to forecast student engagement trends to optimize class schedules.
</learning-insight>

<challenge-reflection>
I struggled with understanding statistical hypothesis testing. I overcame this by revisiting foundational statistics resources and practicing with real-world examples. The peer discussion forums and supplemental videos were particularly helpful.

Given my domain context, my interest, and the insights and challenges I encountered, please provide a comprehensive plan for my first independent data analysis project. The plan should include:

1. A brief overview of the types of research that are valued in my field, specifically focusing on measurements related to my interests.
2. Three interesting and specific research questions I could explore through data analysis in my field.
3. Three possible sources of data that I could use for this project, preferably datasets that are publicly available and free online with links, or suggestions on how I might approach data collection within my school.
4. Three personalized next steps I should take to continue improving my data analysis skills, including recommended resources or courses to deepen my understanding of time series analysis and other relevant techniques.

Additionally, please suggest how I might present my findings to my colleagues in my field in a way that highlights the practical benefits and insights gained from my analysis.
